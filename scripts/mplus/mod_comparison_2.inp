DATA:
  FILE = ema_daily_data.dat;               ! Input the daily data file

VARIABLE:
  NAMES = user_num day_win LOGV_SC LOGV_USC MEAN_NAF DERS;  ! Names of variables in the .dat file
  USEVARIABLES = LOGV_SC LOGV_USC MEAN_NAF DERS;            ! Variables used in the analysis
  CLUSTER = user_num;                                      ! Cluster by user (Level-2)

ANALYSIS:
  TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;                                  ! Multilevel random effects model
  ESTIMATOR = BAYES;                                       ! Use Bayesian estimation
  CHAINS = 3;                                              ! Number of MCMC chains
  BITERATIONS = 100000 (5000);                             ! Max iterations and burn-in
  PROCESSORS = 2;                                          ! Parallel processing for speed

MODEL:
  %WITHIN%
    ! Specify within-level relationships
    DERS ON LOGV_SC (beta_SC);                             ! Effect of SC variability on DERS
    DERS ON LOGV_USC (beta_USC);                           ! Effect of USC variability on DERS
    DERS ON MEAN_NAF (beta_NAF);                             ! Control for Negative Affect

  %BETWEEN%
    ! Specify between-level relationships
    LOGV_SC (phi_SC);                                      ! Between-level variance of SC
    LOGV_USC (phi_USC);                                    ! Between-level variance of USC

MODEL CONSTRAINT:
  NEW(diff_beta);                                          ! Compute the difference in effects
