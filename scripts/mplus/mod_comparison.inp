TITLE: Comparing the effects of SC and USC variability on DERS;

DATA:
  FILE = ema_daily_data.dat;               ! Input the daily data file
  VARIABLE:
    NAMES = user_num day_win LOGV_SC LOGV_USC DERS;  ! Names of variables in the .dat file
    USEVARIABLES = LOGV_SC LOGV_USC DERS;            ! Variables used in the analysis
    CLUSTER = user_num;                              ! Cluster by user (Level-2)

ANALYSIS:
  TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;                            ! Multilevel random effects model
  ESTIMATOR = BAYES;                                 ! Use Bayesian estimation
  CHAINS = 3;                                        ! Number of MCMC chains
  BITERATIONS = 100000 (5000);                       ! Max iterations and burn-in
  PROCESSORS = 2;                                    ! Parallel processing for speed

MODEL:
  %WITHIN%
    ! Specify within-level relationships
    DERS ON LOGV_SC (beta_SC);                      ! Effect of SC variability on DERS
    DERS ON LOGV_USC (beta_USC);                    ! Effect of USC variability on DERS

  %BETWEEN%
    ! Specify between-level relationships
    LOGV_SC (phi_SC);                               ! Between-level variance of SC fluctuations
    LOGV_USC (phi_USC);                             ! Between-level variance of USC fluctuations
    DERS ON LOGV_SC LOGV_USC;                       ! Effects of SC and USC variability on DERS

MODEL CONSTRAINT:
  NEW(diff_beta);                                   ! Compute the difference in effects
  diff_beta = beta_SC - beta_USC;
