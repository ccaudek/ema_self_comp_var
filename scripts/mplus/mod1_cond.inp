TITLE: Conditional model focusing on CMP variability;

DATA:
  FILE = ema_data.dat;

VARIABLE:
  NAMES = user_num day_win time_win CMP NEGAFF DERS;
  USEVARIABLES = CMP NEGAFF DERS;
  CLUSTER = user_num;          ! Numeric user ID for Level-2 clustering
  WITHIN = NEGAFF;             ! Declare NEGAFF as a within-level variable
  BETWEEN = DERS;              ! DERS as a Level-2 predictor

ANALYSIS:
  TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;      ! Multilevel random effects model
  ESTIMATOR = BAYES;           ! Bayesian estimation
  CHAINS = 3;                  ! Number of MCMC chains
  BITERATIONS = 100000 (5000); ! Maximum iterations and burn-in
  PROCESSORS = 2;              ! Parallel computation
  ALGORITHM = GIBBS(RW);       ! Use Gibbs sampling with random walk

MODEL:
  %WITHIN%
    LOGV | CMP;                ! Log residual variance modeled as random coefficients
    CMP ON NEGAFF (beta1);     ! Predict CMP using Negative Affect within subjects

  %BETWEEN%
    CMP (phi_0);               ! Between-level variance of CMP
    LOGV (phi_1);              ! Between-level variance of log residual variance
    DERS ON CMP LOGV (beta2 beta3); ! Predict DERS with average CMP and variability

MODEL PRIORS:
    phi_0 ~ IG(1, 0.1);        ! Informative inverse-gamma prior for variance of average CMP
    phi_1 ~ IG(1, 0.1);        ! Informative inverse-gamma prior for variance of variability
    beta1 ~ N(0, 1);           ! Informative prior for beta1
    beta2 ~ N(0, 1);           ! Informative prior for beta2
    beta3 ~ N(0, 1);           ! Informative prior for beta3

MODEL CONSTRAINT:
  NEW (mean_v var_v);          ! Derived parameters for within-level residual variance
  mean_v = exp(-1 + (1/2)*phi_1); ! Mean of the within-level variance (adjusted intercept)
  var_v = exp(2*(-1) + phi_1)*(exp(phi_1)-1); ! Variance of the within-level variance

OUTPUT:
  TECH8 CINTERVAL(HPD);        ! Request iteration history and HPD intervals
